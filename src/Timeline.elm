# Animating

As seen, given a `timeline` of your model, you can get the current value via:

    Timeline.value timeline

You can also ask something like:

     Timeline.transition 500 timeline

this says: suppose transitions between different states take 500ms. Where am I at?
The answer is of type `Status` which is either:

1.  `At t int`: there is no current transition, we have been at this value for `int` milliseconds
2.  `Transitioning t t float`: we are transitioning from an old `t` to a new one, and float goes from `1.0 -> 0.0`
    as we approach

Now that you know if you are statically at a state, or transitioning to that
state from a previous one, you can use the transition factor to do animations.

Given a timeline, and a value to animate, we can generate a continuous

Note that history is only held long enough to ensure smooth transitions,

values stored in timeline will be automatically discarded when not needed.
You should never need to create or interrogate these directly.

{-| Extract the current (most recent) value from the timeline.

At any point in your view code that doesn't need animations, simply retrieve the
current timeline value and proceed rendering the view as you previously would.

E.g. as a first step in integrating Timeline into your code, simply render your
existing view code:

    view : Timeline Model -> Html Msg
    view timeline =
        let
            model =
                Timeline.value timeline

value =

{-| Maps a timeline. **Very importantly** the new timeline has it's own history.

If

    type alias Model =
        { a : Int, b : Int }

then

    modelTimeline |> Timeline.map .a

returns a timeline of the history of `a` irrespective of `b`.

    modelTimeline |> Timeline.map .b

returns a timeline of the history of `b` irrespective of `a`.

One can thus animate transitions of `a` and `b` (or any other model properties)
independently.

{-| This is for treating non-continuous Timelines as continuous.
Consider this typical example:

e.g.

    type alias PageAModel =
        { a : Bool }

    type alias PageBModel =
        { b : Bool }

    type Model
        = PageA PageAModel
        | PageB PageBModel

Here, the state of the page models are not continuous as viewed form the top
level. They don't always exist.
Elm's type system will remind us that we cannot animate a thing that might not
exist.

To animate `PageA` and `PageB` views, the following is required:

1.  functions that extract `Maybe PageAModel` and `Maybe PageBModel`
    values from `Model`
2.  create a timeline of `Maybe` values and use `withDefault`

e.g.

    pageAModel : Model -> Maybe PageAModel
    pageAModel model =
        case model of
            PageA pageAModel_ ->
                Just pageAModel_

    A Timeline represents the (possibly interrupted) transitions of a value.
    E.g. `A` to `B` to `C`.
    The status of such a timeline's transition will either be
    `Transitioning B C f`, or `At C`.

    Another way of way of viewing this, is each value is it's own transition:

        Just A to Nothing
        Just B to Nothing
        Nothing to Just C

{-| Interrupt.

Interrupt values tell transition generator how do deal with interrupted
transitions.

  - `Reverse`: this is useful when state changes are between 2 values, and
    animations have a reversible quality. (e.g. toggling an opening menu in progress).
    If the opening of a menu has value `Transitioning Closed Open 0.9`, then it has %90 of it's transition remaining.
    A model change from (Open to Closed) will, when transitioned with `Reverse`, have a value of
    `Transitioning Open Closed 0.1`.
  - `Restart`: this is for simply restarting an animation upon interruption.
  - `Peak`: this is useful for an animation that goes to a peak value and ends where it started.
    E.g. "Pulse" or "Flash" style animation. If interrupted, and the has not been reached, the transition will simply
    continue on. If interrupted and the peak has already been reached, the transition will reverse to "peak" again.

{-| Turns a `Timeline (List a)` to a `List (Timeline (Maybe a))`.

When we look at a changing list, typically that list is changing because
values are being inserted or removed or modified.
So, if we are rendering a list into a list-like view, we want to know
what the Timeline is for **each slot**. That's what this is for.

Because a slot (in this visualisation) might start as empty and have
something inserted, or vice versa, we return a `Timeline` of `Maybe a`.

The initial parameter is an `id` function which allows us to track an
